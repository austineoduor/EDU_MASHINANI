			<h1>Animation with Maya</h1>
		  	<p>Maya is a powerful 3D animation software that is used to create everything from feature films to video games. It has a wide range of features that allow animators to create realistic and engaging animations.</p>
		  	<div class="ani-cont">
		  		<h2>Keyframing</h2>
			  	<p>Keyframing is the process of setting key poses for an object at specific points in time. This is the most basic type of animation in Maya, and it is used to create simple movements such as walking or running.</p>
				 <ol>
				 	<li>Select the object you want to animate.</li>
				    <li>Click on the "Animation" menu and select "Keyframe".</li>
				    <li>Set the key pose for the object at the current time.</li>
				    <li>Move the timeline forward and set the next key pose.</li>
				    <li>Continue setting key poses until you have created the entire animation.</li>
				  </ol>
			    <h2>Tweening</h2>
			    <p>Tweening is the process of creating intermediate frames between two key poses. This is used to smooth out the animation and make it more fluid.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Select the two key poses you want to tween.</li>
				    <li>Click on the "Animation" menu and select "Tween".</li>
				    <li>Maya will automatically create intermediate frames between the two key poses.</li>
				</ol>
			    <h2>Motion Capture</h2>

			    <ol>
			    	<li>Set up a motion capture system.</li>
				    <li>Have the actor perform the desired movement.</li>
				    <li>The motion capture system will record the actor's movement.</li>
				    <li>Import the motion capture data into Maya.</li>
				    <li>Create an animation based on the motion capture data.</li>
			    </ol>
			    <h2>Animation Tools</h2>
